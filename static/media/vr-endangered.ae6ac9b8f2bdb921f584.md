In 2020, I bought my first VR headset. I had the disposable income and wanted to avoid Facebook so I decided to purchase a Valve Index kit. The kit contained:

-   A VR Headset.
-   Two external tracker base stations.
-   Two finger tracking

Steam has created a compelling package that ties in directly with its computer software "SteamVR".

And this is why I believe VR has no future in the PC gaming ecosystem unless major steps are taken.
